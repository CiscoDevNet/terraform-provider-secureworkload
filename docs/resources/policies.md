  Resource for creating a new policy on Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_policies" "policy1" {
       workspace_id = secureworkload_workspace.workspace.id
       consumer_filter_id = secureworkload_filter.any.id
       provider_filter_id = secureworkload_cluster.web.id
      policy_action = "ALLOW"
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
