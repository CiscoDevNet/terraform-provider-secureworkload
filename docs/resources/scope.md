# secureworkload_scope (Resource)

Resource for creating a scope in Secure Workload

## Example
An example is shown below: 
```hcl
resource "secureworkload_scope" "scope" {
    short_name = "Terraform-created-scope"
    sub_type = "DNS_SERVERS"
    short_query = file("${path.module}/query_file.json") 
	 parent_app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
}

resource "secureworkload_scope" "scope2" {
    short_name = "Terraform-created-scope2"
    query = <<EOF
                { 
        		 "type":"subnet",
        		 "field": "ip",
        		 "value": "10.0.1.0/24"
        		 }
        	EOF
    sub_type = "GENERIC"
	 parent_app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
}
```
Example of **query_file.json**
```json
{	
	"type": "or",
	"filters": [ 
	  {
	"type": "and",
		"filters": [ 
		  { 
			"type": "contains",
			"field": "user_orchestrator_system/name",
			"value": "Random"
		  },
		  {
			"type": "eq",
			"field": "ip",
			"value": "10.0.1.1"
		  }
		]
	  },
	  {
		"type": "gt",
		"field": "host_tags_cvss",
		"value": 2
	  }
	]
  }
```
**Note:** If creating multiple resources for scope during a single `terraform apply`, you may have to use `depends_on` to chain the resources so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.

- `created_at` (Number) Unix Epoch timestamp when scope was created.
- `dirty` (Boolean) Indicates a child or parent query has been updated and that the changes need to be committed..
