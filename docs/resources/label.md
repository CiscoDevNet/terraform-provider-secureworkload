  Resource for creating a new label in Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_label" "label-1" {
       ip = "1.2.3.4"
      root_scope_name = "scope_name"
      attributes = {
          Environment = "test"
          Datacenter = "aws"
          app_name = "app_name"
      }
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple resources for label during a single terraform apply, you may have to use depends_on to chain the resources so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
