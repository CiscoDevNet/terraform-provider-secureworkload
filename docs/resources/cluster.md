  Resource for creating a new Cluster on Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_cluster" "cluster" {
       workspace_id = data.secureworkload_workspace.workspace.id
      name = "New-Cluster"
      description = "New Cluster via TF"
      query = <<EOF
                  {                "type":"eq",
                   "field": "ip",
                   "value": "10.0.0.1"
                   }
              EOF
      approved = false 
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
