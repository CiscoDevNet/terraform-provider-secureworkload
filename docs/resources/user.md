  Resource for creating a user in Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_user" "new_user" {
      email = "test@domain.com"
      first_name = "test"
      last_name = "user"
       app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
      role_ids = ["<ROLE_IDS>"]
      enable_existing = true 
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
