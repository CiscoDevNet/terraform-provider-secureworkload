  Resource for creating a new service port on Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_port" "port1" {
       policy_id = secureworkload_policies.policy1.id
      start_port = 80 
      end_port = 80 
      proto = 6 
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple resources for ports during a single terraform apply, you may have to use depends_on to chain the resources so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
