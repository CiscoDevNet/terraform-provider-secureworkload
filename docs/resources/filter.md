  Resource for creating a new filter in Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_filter" "filter1" {
       app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
      name = "New-Filter"
      query = <<EOF
                  {                "type":"eq",
                   "field": "ip",
                   "value": "10.0.0.1"
                   }
              EOF
      primary = true 
      public = false 
  }
  resource "secureworkload_filter" "filter2" {
       depends_on = [secureworkload_filter.filter1]
       app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
      name = "New-Filter2"
      query = <<EOF
                  {                "type":"subnet",
                   "field": "ip",
                   "value": "10.0.2.0/24"
                   }
              EOF
      primary = true 
      public = false 
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple filters during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the filters so that terraform creates them in a specific order to avoid 429:toomanyrequest error.

# secureworkload_filter (Resource)

Resource for creating a new filter in Secure Workload

## Example
An example is shown below: 
```hcl
resource "secureworkload_filter" "filter1" {
	 app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
    name = "New-Filter"
    query = <<EOF
                {        		 "type":"eq",
        		 "field": "ip",
        		 "value": "10.0.0.1"
        		 }
        	EOF
    primary = true 
    public = false 
}
resource "secureworkload_filter" "filter2" {
	 depends_on = [secureworkload_filter.filter1]
	 app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
    name = "New-Filter2"
    query = <<EOF
                {        		 "type":"subnet",
        		 "field": "ip",
        		 "value": "10.0.2.0/24"
        		 }
        	EOF
    primary = true 
    public = false 
}
```
**Note:** If creating multiple filters during a single `terraform apply`, remember to use `depends_on` to chain the filters so that terraform creates them in a specific order to avoid *429:too_many_request* error.
