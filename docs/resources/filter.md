  Resource for creating a new filter in Secure Workload
  Example
  An example is shown below:
  hcl
  resource "secureworkload_filter" "filter1" {
       app_scope_id = data.secureworkload_scope.scope.id
      name = "New-Filter"
      query = <<EOF
                  {                "type":"eq",
                   "field": "ip",
                   "value": "10.0.0.1"
                   }
              EOF
      primary = true 
      public = false 
  }
  
  Note: If creating multiple rules during a single terraform apply, remember to use depends_on to chain the rules so that terraform creates it in the same order that you intended.
